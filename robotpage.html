	Hi, Iam Roboace.I am a robot of Electronics and Communication Deparment of Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science. I can do many jobs. I am able to guide you to the destinations you want to go. I will tell and show you the route to different locations. When there is an obstacle in my path that hinders my motion, I will detect it and reroute by myself and guide you to the location.I will introduce you all faculties members of this department by using my face recognition module. You can speak to me, I will hear you and reply back and I am able to recognize the text you writes. You can monitor me by using this webpage or my mobile application. ECE department is having a small library. Books can be searched by my webpage by using the book code and you will get notified about the rack number and location of corresponding book. Yea! that is all about me. I am here to help you :)
